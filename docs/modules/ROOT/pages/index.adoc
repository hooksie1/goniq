= Overview

https://gitlab.com/hooksie1/goniq[Goniq^] is a very simple cross-platform program to remove duplicate lines.


== Input Types
Goniq can take inputs from stdin or a file and the inputs to *not* need to be sorted.

To use a file, just use the filename as an argument.

== Examples

    echo "test thing test thing other" | goniq

    goniq words.txt

NOTE: I suck at development. This works, but most likely sucks. Feel free to make it better.
