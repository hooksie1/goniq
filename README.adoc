= Goniq

Goniq is a very simple cross-platform program to remove duplicate lines.

Goniq can take inputs from stdin or a file and the inputs to *not* need to be sorted.

To use a file, just use the filename as an argument.


Note: I suck at development. This works, but most likely sucks. Feel free to make it better.

Note: This is mirrored on Github from GitLab. Any issues should be opened on GitLab.com.
